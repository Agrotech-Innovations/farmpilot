# Farm Components Architecture

This folder contains all farm-related UI components organized using Clean Architecture principles for better maintainability and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Shared**: Components that can be reused across different features
- **Layout**: Components responsible for dashboard structure and layout
- **Overview**: Components that provide high-level summaries and overviews
- **Features**: Domain-specific components organized by farm management areas

### 2. **Scalability**

- Each feature has its own directory for future expansion
- Large components can be broken down into smaller sub-components within their feature directory
- Clear boundaries between different functional areas

### 3. **Maintainability**

- Consistent naming conventions
- Barrel exports for clean imports
- Self-contained feature modules
- Clear documentation and structure

## 📦 Component Categories

### Shared Components

These are generic, reusable components that don't contain business logic specific to any particular farm management feature:

- `MetricCard`: Displays key performance indicators
- `ActivityItem`: Shows individual activity entries
- `AlertCard`: Displays alerts and notifications

### Layout Components

Components responsible for the overall dashboard structure:

- `DashboardHeader`: Main header with navigation and quick actions
- `MetricsGrid`: Grid layout system for displaying metrics

### Overview Components

Components that provide summary information across the farm:

- `RecentActivity`: Shows recent farm activities
- `AlertsWeather`: Weather-related alerts and information
- `PerformanceSummary`: Overall farm performance metrics

### Feature Components

Domain-specific components organized by farm management areas:

- **Inventory**: Stock management, supply tracking
- **Equipment**: Machinery maintenance, equipment status
- **Tasks**: Work assignment, task tracking
- **Analytics**: Data visualization, reporting
- **Livestock**: Animal health, breeding records
- **Crops**: Planting schedules, crop rotation

## 🔄 Future Improvements

### Component Decomposition

Large components (>200 lines) should be broken down into smaller, focused components:

**Example for Livestock Health Dashboard:**

```
features/livestock/
├── livestock-health-dashboard.tsx    # Main container
├── components/
│   ├── health-stats-grid.tsx        # Health statistics
│   ├── animal-list.tsx              # List of animals
│   ├── vaccination-schedule.tsx     # Vaccination tracking
│   ├── health-records.tsx           # Medical records
│   └── treatment-form.tsx           # Treatment scheduling
└── index.ts
```

### State Management

Consider implementing proper state management for complex features:

- Use React Context for feature-specific state
- Implement custom hooks for business logic
- Separate data fetching from UI components

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for feature modules
- Visual regression tests for UI components

## 📝 Usage Examples

```typescript
// Import specific components
import {MetricCard, ActivityItem} from '@/components/farm/shared';
import {DashboardHeader} from '@/components/farm/layout';
import {InventoryManagement} from '@/components/farm/features/inventory';

// Import entire feature modules
import * as InventoryComponents from '@/components/farm/features/inventory';
import * as SharedComponents from '@/components/farm/shared';
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Keep components focused**: Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Use TypeScript interfaces**: Define clear props interfaces for all components
3. **Follow naming conventions**: Use PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files
4. **Implement proper error boundaries**: Handle errors gracefully in complex components
5. **Optimize performance**: Use React.memo for expensive components
6. **Document complex logic**: Add JSDoc comments for complex business logic
